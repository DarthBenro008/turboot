- Add the modules you would like to create in the `DEFAULT_MODS` array
- Now run `chmod +x turboot.sh && ./turboo.sh -g <YOUR PACKAGE MANAGER>`
- A file would with the name of `<Features PACKAGE MANAGER>.sh` would have been generated

- Run turboot using `./turboot.sh`
- Complete the prompt to install and configure your dotfiles!
- You can also add custom and default modules for your liking!

## üéø Features

### üß± Modularity

The way turboot works is concept of modules. Each package manager has its own file. For eg, apt has its own file named `apt.sh` , `dnf` has its own file named `dnf.sh` and these file contain Installtion instructions for the module you have defined in turboot.

You can tinker with the configs to your liking:

```bash
# Global Mods, this is where you define modules for turboot to detect
MODS=("zsh" "tmux" "oh_my_zsh" "node" "yarn" "nvim" "vim_plug" "python" "fzf") 
 # Default mods are those mods that get installed by default when turboot runs
DEFAULT_MODS=("zsh" "tmux" "oh_my_zsh" "node" "yarn" "nvim" "vim_plug") 
# Location to save your config file  
CONF_FILE="$HOME/.turbootrc"    
```

### ‚úç Writting a Module/Generating Package Manager Template

As turboot works with modularity, if you want a module add it in the `MODS` section and then run `./turboot -g <YOUR PACKAGE MANAGER SHORTHAND>`, your package manager shorthand could be apt, dnf, pacman, yay or literally anything. 

Turboot will generate a file `<YOUR PACKAGE MANAGE SHORTHAND>.sh`, and you can populate the modules installation script. 

This is how it looks for `apt.sh` for the above given modules.

```bash
# Package Manager template for apt

install_zsh() {
    sudo apt-get install zsh
}

install_tmux() {
    sudo apt install tmux
}

install_oh_my_zsh() {
    sh -c "curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh"
}

install_p10k() {
    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
}

install_node() {
    curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
}

install_yarn() {
    sudo npm install --global yarn
}

install_nvim() {
    sudo apt install neovim
}

install_vim_plug() {
    sh -c 'curl -fLo "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}"/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim'
}

install_fzf() {
    sudo apt-get install fzf
}

```

Then you can create a new function name `install_<module name>(){}` and write the function for your module.

> NOTE: the module name should not contain spaces and should follow snake case system.

### üí™ Ability to automatically detect your distro and install your configs

- when you run turboot for the first time, it automatically detects your distro and stores it in `.turbootrc` file. You can change the OS and package manager settings either in the configs or turboot will ask if the configs are correct, you can simply press "n" and turboot will ask you for the right details.

### üîó Symlink Support

Modify the following to add your own symlink to your dotfiles!

```bash
create_symlinks() {
    # Creating Symlinks
    ln -sf $CWD/.alacritty.yml ~/.alacritty.yml
    ln -sf $CWD/nvim ~/.config/nvim
    ln -sf $CWD/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
    ln -sf $CWD/.p10k.zsh ~/.p10k
    e_success "Created symlinks to configs"
}
```
